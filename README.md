# Re:INVENT
Re:INVENT is an initiative to put innovation, creativity, openness, sharing, transparency and collaboration in practice to ensure that everyone can provide in their basic human needs and move towards a safe and just space for humanity. We do this with what we call Permissionless Innovation and Open Source Design. We reinvent product development, start-ups, intellectual property, ownership and scaling up for impact.

## Mission
Our mission is to bring the power of technology, product design and fabrication in the hands of the people, so every community on the planet has the ability to create their own livelihood.

## Re:INVENT_You
We are looking for people and organizations that are front-runners in innovation and solutions development, who do not just scout and consume existing products, but want to take an active role in co-creating them.
